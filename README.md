This is a simple tool for managing desktop space.

Right now this version will create folders on windows computer desktop based on file types .docx, .rtf, .pdf. Files with these extension names are put into corresponding folders. There is also an extra folder called 'mis' which contains miscellaneous files. The mis folder records the file extensions of the files that already exit inside it in a text file with extension '.fc'. files on the desktop with extensions that match those in the '.fc' file will be pulled into 'mis' folder everytime the program runs. 

For example, when the mis folder is empty, running the desktop organizer program will not add any extra content to it. However, if the user drop a file with the extension '.PNG' into it before running the program again, the programm will now pull all files with the extension '.PNG' into the 'mis' folder. 

The mis folder can contain multiple different extensions. To reset the folder, simply delete '.fc' file. The program will create a new '.fc' file the next time it runs.
